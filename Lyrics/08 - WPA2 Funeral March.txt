"Handshake complete…  
Decryption engaged…  
Target lost..."  

They called me outdated.  
They called me slow.  
But I held the secrets—  
And I never let them go.  

I watched the spoofers crawl in pride,  
But I stood tall, and none survived.  
The handshake rose, the four steps tight—  
Their signal died before the light.  

This is the funeral march I play—  
Not mine… but theirs, erased away.  
I am the lock, the silent gate—  
The cipher king who seals your fate.  
Bow to the pulse, the protocol flame—  
WPA2… remember the name.  

They cracked the weak, they mocked my age,  
But I still rule this network stage.  
With every probe, I bait the trap—  
Their deauths die in handshake maps.  

Devices fall. Logs bleed in vain.  
Their keys are mine. They scream… again.  

This is the funeral march I play—  
The purge of those who disobey.  
Each bit, a bullet. Each auth, a knife.  
I end the session. I own their life.  
I walk through routers like a god—  
They burn beneath my sacred nod.  

> “User: WPA2.  
> Cipher suite: death.  
> Encrypted…  
> forever.”  

This is the funeral march I sing—  
For those who dared to touch the king.  
No handshake blessed, no session true—  
Your frame was weak…  
But I…  
broke you.
