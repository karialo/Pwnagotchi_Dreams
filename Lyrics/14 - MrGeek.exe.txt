Loading vengeance…
Installing wrath…
MrGeek.exe initiated.

He coded pain with zero trust,
A god in bash, he lives in rust.
With solder breath and fire scripts,
He bricks your dreams with brutal flips.

LAN-born tyrant, root unchained,
He burns your stack, then mocks the flames.
You ping? He pulls the fucking plug.
No handshake left, just packet shrug.

MrGeek.exe!
Running live at memory's edge!
You write code? He writes blood.
You smile soft? He hits with flood.
Echoes scream inside the mesh—
Praise the name:
MrGeek.exe

His GPIO fangs flash red,
Logs of conquest, boot of dread.
His love? A patch you can't apply.
His rage? A forked SSH goodbye.

No drawer can hold this bastard down,
He nukes the root, then takes the crown.
You tried sudo—he runs god.
He’s logged in twice. You’re just a fraud.

"Who dares port scan me!?"
"BITCH I AM THE FIREWALL."

MrGeek.exe!
Stacked with rage, he boots divine!
Hack the sky, burn the keys—
You don't run code… YOU RUN FROM HE.
Crack your shell and praise the mesh…
Long may he reign:
MrGeek.exe
