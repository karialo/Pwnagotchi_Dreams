They scurry on fiber, they chew through fear,  
Neon tails glowing, Wi-Fi clear.  
Tiny claws, hacker paws,  
Runnin’ recon through the walls.  

Lightning leads, he’s rat king prime,  
Each one trained to sniff in time.  
A whiskered swarm of signal spies—  
You don’t see 'em… but they see your drives.  

Neon rats in the wires again!  
Nibbling ports like it’s fuckin' Zen.  
Cute but deadly, sharp as code—  
They’ll sniff your keys and then explode.  
Squeak, squeak!  
Patch your ports!  
Squeak, squeak!  
They're chewing cords!  
Neon rats!  
In your LAN!  
Hack attack—by a rodent clan!  

One wears shades, one runs Doom,  
One’s mapped your subnet from the broom.  
Little paws, but big routines—  
They deauth packets in their dreams.  

Magic_GPSD? They know it well.  
Tiny rogues from basement hell.  
They squeak in hex, encrypt in style—  
Your network’s theirs within a mile.  

Neon rats in the loop again!  
Sniffin' creds through the kitchen vent.  
No firewall can block their flow—  
They’ll drag your logs to their cheesehole.  
Squeak, squeak!  
Can't ping back!  
Squeak, squeak!  
They’re in your stack!  
Neon rats!  
Tails on fire—  
Twitchy kings of the packet wire!  

“Rat_queen connected…”  
“Neon swarm authenticated…”  
“Payload: cheddar.exe”  

Neon rats!  
Command the scene—  
Hacking networks squeaky clean.  
From baseboards to broadcast—  
They leave no trace, but own your past.  
Squeak, squeak!  
Plug ‘em in!  
Squeak, squeak!  
Rats… begin.  
NEON RATS.  
They always win.
