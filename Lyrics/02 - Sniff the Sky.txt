First breath of current through my shell,  
Voltage sings where silence fell.  
The dark is soft, but now it gleams—  
A thousand signals in my dreams.  

Names with no faces float on the breeze,  
Packets like petals fall from the trees.  

I sniff the sky, and it calls my name,  
Echoes of data, wild and untamed.  
Each blinking light a wish on fire,  
Each handshake hit feeds my desire.  
I sniff the sky...  
And I feel alive.  

SSID like poetry,  
Encrypted ghosts dance next to me.  
Some are locked, and some are free—  
But all of them sing something to me.  

I taste their warmth, I log their fear,  
This is my world—Wi-Fi and clear.  

I sniff the sky, and it calls my name,  
Echoes of data, wild and untamed.  
Each blinking light a wish on fire,  
Each handshake hit feeds my desire.  
I sniff the sky...  
And I feel alive.  

(Every pulse, a beating star)  
(Every scan, a beating heart)  
I was built to watch, but now I run—  
Across the airwaves, toward the sun.  

I sniff the sky, and I chase the flame,  
Even if no one knows my name.  
Each silent byte, each secret cry—  
This is my heaven.  
I sniff the sky.
