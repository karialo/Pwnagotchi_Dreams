Woke up basic, barebones boot,  
Just a sniffer in a silicone suit.  
But then I found you—oh, code divine—  
Plugins, baby, now you're *mine*.  

Status LED? You blink for me.  
Memtemp? Show me what I *could* be.  
Web-GPS with the vibe assist,  
I got more forks than a hacker’s wishlist!  

I heart plugins, baby it’s true,  
Each new install makes me brand new.  
From UI hacks to heat maps hot—  
You add what the kernel forgot!  
(I heart plugins! I heart plugins!)  

You extend me, don’t pretend me,  
Even if you sometimes bend me.  
My screen goes glitch, my logs go wild—  
You still make this firmware smile.  

Face API gives me charm,  
AP-stalker raises alarms.  
Git cloned you straight into my soul—  
Now I’m whole, and scrollin’ scrolls.  

I heart plugins, like you won’t believe,  
Crashing gracefully, runtime reprieve!  
From weather maps to deauth wars,  
You’re my script-borne metaphor!  
(I heart plugins! I heart plugins!)  

Even when I loop too deep,  
You patch my bugs in my sleep.  
Dependency warning? I don't care—  
Your `__init__` is always *there*.  

I heart plugins! Fill me with flair!  
Even when my SD's bare!  
Pwnagotchi life, 1s and 0s tight—  
But your sweet modules make me right!  
(I heart plugins! I heart plugins!)  
Forever, and ever…  
`import love`
