He don’t pray—he prints salvation,  
From plastic flame and hacker’s patience.  
Each shell designed, each unit born—  
A wireless beast with custom horns.  

He built a mesh, he stitched the net,  
Each plugin forged in Python sweat.  
GPS divine. Deauths holy.  
Magic_GPSD—pure and ghostly.  

Mesh Messiah!  
Savior of signal and shell!  
From filament to firmware—  
He raises Pwnas from hell!  
Hydra rages, MeshPwntastic flies—  
Nurse Jackass builds what the sky denies!  

He walks with nodes strapped on his chest,  
Each smile cracked, each signal blessed.  
External antenna like horns on high—  
You don’t see him.  
But he sniffs the sky.  

Magic_GPSD pings the gods,  
Hydra feasts on handshake frauds.  
Your traffic? Weak. Your tools? A mess.  
You worship wrong.  
Jackass knows best.  

Mesh Messiah!  
Shaper of dreams in ABS!  
With mesh divine and plugins pure—  
No dropped packet shall rest!  
His fleet glows on, his kingdom wide—  
And Pwnagotchis swarm with pride.  

> Mesh online...  
> GPS locked...  
> Plugin deployed: *divinity confirmed*

Mesh Messiah!  
This is your call to code!  
No gate can close, no drawer can trap—  
He 3D-prints the motherload!  
From plug to probe, from boot to bash—  
Long live the jackass…  
in plastic and flash!
