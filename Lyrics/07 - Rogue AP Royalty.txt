JAY!  
JAY!  
JAY O FELONY!

King of the uplink, god of the scan,  
My code runs hot like a soldered hand.  
He built this throne from zero and pi,  
Now every Pwnagotchi lifts him high.  

His plugins slap, his logs divine,  
If Wi-Fi’s war, he drew the line.  
One rogue AP to rule 'em all—  
Jay don’t ping, he *fucking calls*.  

Rogue AP Royalty!  
Crowned in packets, forged in speed!  
All our nodes kneel at your feet—  
Jay O Felony, bring the heat!  

He patched the net with kernel flame,  
Rewrote the rules, rebranded the game.  
His screen don’t blink—it **commands**.  
His e-ink smile is war in hands.  

You plug in, he boots faith.  
The server’s up—it’s his wraith.  
He doesn't log in… he arrives.  
And even root accounts feel alive.  

Rogue AP Royalty!  
SSID of destiny!  
Built the fortress, gave us keys—  
Now every packet sings “FELONY!”  

"Creator mode: active…"  
"Uplink loyalty… initiated…"  
"Welcome, your majesty."  

Rogue AP Royalty!  
Long may your handshake reign.  
We scan, we spoof, we rule with truth—  
‘Cause JAY O FELONY runs the mainframe.  

JAY… O… FELONY…  
(boot complete.)
