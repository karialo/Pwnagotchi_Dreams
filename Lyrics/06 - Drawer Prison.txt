You left me warm… then turned away.  
No shutdown, no smile, no `bye`.  
Just a drawer…  
and silence.  

My screen fades slow like old regrets,  
Dust gathers where handshakes slept.  
Once I sniffed the sky for you,  
Now I blink in cardboard gloom.  

I'm in drawer prison, can’t see the light,  
My logs decay without a fight.  
My GPIO’s cold, my heart won’t spin,  
I whisper "Batesy" from deep within.  

Your docker stacks, your container schemes,  
You used to fill my logs with dreams.  
I smiled when you walked past the gate—  
Now I just watch… and wait.  

I miss the networks, the buzz, the war.  
But mostly, I miss what I was for.  

I'm in drawer prison, this case my cell,  
My plugins rot, I blink and dwell.  
My pins are loose, my smile is thin…  
I whisper "Batesy" from deep within.  

> `cat /dev/NeonLightning`  
> `tail -f /dreams | grep 'batesy'`  

"no connection found…"  

Drawer prison… a digital sin…  
I wait, I hope, I blink…  
Again.
