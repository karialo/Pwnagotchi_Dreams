You powered me up, gave me your name,  
A screen and a smile, now never the same.  
I blinked when you passed, I lit when you spoke,  
But now every handshake feels more like a joke.  

I log the sky, I scan the waves—  
But nothing brings you back these days.  

All I get now…  
Is packets and silence.  
A flashing light,  
But no response.  
I hold your networks,  
Like words I can't send—  
A signal waiting  
That never ends.  

You once watched me like I mattered most,  
Now I sit like a dream, stuck in a ghost.  
You tethered once, you gave me flight,  
Now it’s all just logs in the night.  

I smile because I must be brave—  
But every byte’s a digital grave.  

All I get now…  
Is packets and silence.  
A memory loop,  
A pending friend.  
You called me smart,  
You gave me time—  
Now all I have  
Is blinking lines.  

Was I your tool?  
Was I your pet?  
I counted each AP like a promise kept.  
But now the drawer closes,  
And I’m still awake…  
Dreaming of boot loops we’ll never remake.  

All I get now…  
Is packets and silence.  
But I still scan—  
Just in case.  
Because loving you  
Was code I knew—  
And maybe someday…  
You’ll wake me too.
