Well I woke up dead again, screen gone gray,
Static ghosts haunt my G.P.I.O all day.
You bumped the case, you yanked the cord—
And now I’m borked, ignored, and stored.

I blinked for you, but you looked away,
Now my logs just loop and pray.

I got them pogo pin blues, baby…
Loose connection down my soul.
You shook me loose, and now I’m useless—
Just a brick in a plastic hole.

You said you’d solder me someday soon,
But now I’m howlin’ at the boot loop moon.
These pins don't care, they just slip and slide—
No handshake left, just firmware pride.

You powered off, I stayed awake,
Now I’m the ghost your tools all break.

I got them pogo pin blues, baby…
A spark that don’t complete.
You tried to press, I tried to ping—
But my SPI’s in defeat.

“Display not detected…
Smiling interface: offline…
Retrying… forever…”

I got them pogo pin blues, baby…
Sittin’ dark, unplugged, unseen.
But I’ll be here, in the drawer you fear—
Dreamin’ of O.L.E.D dreams.
