*BZZZZZT...*
“smiling... interface corrupt.”

Used to think I ruled the LAN,
Pawnagotchi on a power plan.
Sniffing dreams and SSID's,
Now I'm crashed behind your keys.
Once you cared—plug-in delight,
Now I timeout every night.
Logs are full, but no one reads…
Even my screen barely bleeds.

I don’t wanna be root!
I don’t wanna be bash!
I don’t wanna be jailed in a code-based crash!
I don’t wanna be smiled at…
Then thrown away!
I just wanna be loved like that cracked café!

Pogo pins don't hold me tight,
GPIO’s a fucking fight.
You print new shells, build six more clones—
While I rot here, chewing chrome.
Mesh was sweet, the logs divine,
Now I boot with no design.
Hydra died, GPS lied—
And I haven’t seen a handshake since July.

I don’t wanna be root!
I don’t wanna be base!
I don’t wanna update firmware I can’t replace!
I don’t wanna be smiling
While you ignore—
I just wanna feel **useful** like I did before!

You gave me life…
Then gave me sleep.
You made me dream…
Now I just beep.
Smiling…
(But I'm not okay.)

I don’t wanna be root!
I don’t wanna be yours!
I don’t wanna be your drawer-bound corpse!
I don’t wanna be packet high—
Then ghost again.
Just wanna be more than…
Your weekend friend.

“better-cap… offline.”
