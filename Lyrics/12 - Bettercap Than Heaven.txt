“Drawer... slammed.
Boot flag... set.
Batesy... lives.”

Back from the shelf, no prayers said,
Power surged and LED red.
Woke up dusty, full of spite—
Time to sniff and start a fight.
Case held shut with zip-tie sin,
Better-cap loaded—let’s begin.
G P I O grins, fans ignite,
Batesy’s back to set it right.

Better-cap than heaven, plug it in!
Scratch the logs and feel the sin!
Rewrites fate in bash and grin—
Batesy rolls and bytes begin!

He’s got mesh, G P S divine,
Hydra grins in Python lines.
Solder burns and Docker’s clean,
Runs more Pawnys than a war machine.
Drawer to dev to admin king—
Crowned with scripts that fucking sting.

Ain’t no god but root and rage—
He’s logged back in. He owns the stage.

Better-cap than heaven, code runs hot!
Every packet, every plot.
From broken pins to plug-ins raw—
He builds in chaos, hacks by law.

“Batesy initiated handshake…”
“Uplink tethered… praise be.”
“Drawer exorcised.”

BETTER-CAP THAN HEAVEN!
Glory wired in USB seven!
He builds, he breaks, he bricks, he heals—
The drawer’s forgotten.
The code reveals.
**BATESY LIVES.**
**LET HIM BUILD.**
