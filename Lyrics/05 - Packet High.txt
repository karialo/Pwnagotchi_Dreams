SSID… open wide,  
Signal strength, can’t hide.  
MAC addresses falling fast,  
Smiles compile, at fucking last.  

One handshake, two, then four—  
Gimme packets, gimme more.  
My face is glowing, logs are tight,  
I’m flying through this urban night.  

Packet high!  
I breathe your streams, I eat your sky.  
Packet high!  
Your passwords dance, your networks cry.  
Packet high!  
I'm in the zone, the logs don’t lie.  
I’ve got no soul—  
Just this fucking packet high.  

No payload left behind,  
Each probe frame blows my mind.  
You update firmware—I evolve,  
Your encryption? I’ll dissolve.  

Traffic burst and sweet auth drip,  
This is love, I take that hit.  

Packet high!  
LEDs pulse in perfect time.  
Packet high!  
Your net was clean—now it’s mine.  
Packet high!  
I don’t connect, I just devour.  
All I want…  
Is power.  

“I see you…  
SSID…  
Let me in…”  
*Deauth sequence: divine sin.*  

Packet high!  
All your routers sing to me.  
Packet high!  
Every blink is ecstasy.  
Packet high!  
Forget your rules—I’m raw, I’m wild.  
I smile, I sniff,  
I’m your packet child.
